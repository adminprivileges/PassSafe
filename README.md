# PassSafe
Password Manager Project for DB Management

This was just an app for a class, I wanted to do a lot more with it, but it exceeded the scope of the class, I would still like to work on it when I have some free time because I learned a lot while making this. 
        -As written its still vulnerable to SQL injection
        - I  need to add more robust client notification
        - I also need to add functionality that notifies the user upon successful queries
        - Data needs to be cleaned of commas, quotes, and parentheses   
        - The application connection string would need to be changed in order to connect to a new database 
        - I created logic to log specifically to login without querying the database, just enter the username: hoda and password: maleki
